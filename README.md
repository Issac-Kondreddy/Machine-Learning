# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to my Machine Learning Repository! This repository contains a collection of basic code implementations for various machine learning algorithms. It includes algorithms for classification, regression, unsupervised learning, and deep learning.

## Contents
- **Classification Algorithms**: Includes algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
- **Regression Algorithms**: Covers Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, etc.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Features algorithms such as K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, PCA, etc.
- **Deep Learning**: Contains basic neural network implementations, CNNs, RNNs, etc.

## Getting Started
